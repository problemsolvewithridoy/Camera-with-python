# Camera with Python
This repository contains code examples and tutorials for using a camera with Python.

# Requirements
To run the code examples in this repository, you will need:
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV
3. A camera connected to your computer (built-in or external)

# Getting started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages (Python 3.x and OpenCV) if you haven't already.
3. Connect your camera to your computer and make sure it is recognized.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded this repository.
5. Run the Python script for the example you want to try (e.g., python capture_image.py to capture a single image from your camera).

# Code examples
This repository contains the following code examples:

1. capture_image.py: captures a single image from the camera and saves it to disk.
2. capture_video.py: captures video from the camera and displays it in a window.
3. face_detection.py: detects faces in the camera feed and draws bounding boxes around them.
4. object_detection.py: detects objects in the camera feed using a pre-trained TensorFlow model and draws bounding boxes around them.
5. Each example is well-documented and includes detailed explanations of the code.
